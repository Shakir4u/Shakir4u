# Mohd. Shakir Hussain 👋

I'm Mohd. Shakir Hussain — a passionate Senior Android & Java Developer with 6+ years of experience building scalable mobile and backend solutions. I build production-grade Android apps and robust backend systems, giving me a full-stack perspective across mobile, server, and CI/CD.

## 🚀 What I do

### Android Development
Expert in Java, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Firebase, Room, Retrofit and modern Android Jetpack libraries. I deliver reliable, maintainable, and performant Android apps — from UI/UX to architecture and testing.

### Backend Engineering
Skilled in Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Microservices and RESTful API design. I design containerized, cloud-ready services (GCP) and CI/CD pipelines for production environments.

### DevOps & Testing
Hands-on with Docker, CI/CD, SonarQube, Git/Bitbucket, and performance optimization. I use JUnit, Mockito and Espresso to ensure quality through unit and instrumented tests.
